# REGULUS: A Basic Encrypted File Sharing System 

## Overview

– An end-to-end encrypted file sharing system where users can authenticate using username/password, save/load/edit files on an insecure server, share
saved files with other users, and revoke user access to previously shared files.

– Project implemented in Golang. Uses HMAC + block-cipher encryption (CBC) to securely store files on an insecure datastore and Digital Signatures + RSA encryption for secure sharing.
